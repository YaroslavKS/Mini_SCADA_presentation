# SCADA Dashboard Simulation

This is a simple interactive web-based SCADA-style dashboard built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The dashboard visually simulates a boiler and turbine system with animated piping and real-time monitoring of:

- **Temperature** (°C)
- **Pressure** (kPa)
- **Turbine Speed** (RPM)

Each parameter is displayed both as a live sensor and as a time-series chart using **Chart.js**.

## Features

- Real-time simulated sensor data
- SCADA-style system diagram with color-coded flow
- Animated pipe flow effect
- Status indicators (✅ OK / ⚠️ Warning) with automatic color changes
- Responsive layout and dark mode design

## Purpose

This project was created as a small practical demonstration of understanding **industrial control systems (SCADA)**.  
It aims to showcase:
- Basic front-end development skills
- Familiarity with real-time monitoring concepts
- Visualization of industrial processes

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, animations)
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Chart.js

## Live Preview

You can open `index.html` in any browser to see it in action.
